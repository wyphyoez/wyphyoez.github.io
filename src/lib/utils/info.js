	about: `I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer based in Meiktila, Myanmar.
   I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between.
   I have been working for 3 year, with a demonstrated history of working in the Computer Software industry. Skilled in Front-end Development.
   I have 3 years of experience in HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, tailwind CSS, StyledComponent, React JS and Next JS. Hence,
   I have successfully completed several web projects from scratch. 
   Yet, I learn continuously and never stop exploring new technologies.
   So, I have also gained knowledge of Node JS, Express JS, Mongo DB, Python,
   firebase and React Native with time.
